This stuff may be implemented later after the main plan.md
- silence skipping threshold confugration
- userreport button and count in db on whether threshold is too high or too low (skips non-silence or doesn't skip silence), can vote and stuff
- address stuff like student questions being quieter than main speaker, maybe local thresholding or something
