- want to add posthog to try it
- social app previews (can use deArrow)
- tasteful extra features (hidden behind tools button)
    - if at all possible: silence skipper
        - we can seek the video through the iframe!
        - and change the playback rate (need to check if supports custom ones)
        - to get silence level, can't go direct to youtube
            - can process video silence timestamps server side (could be a public good database even)
            - could determine it from transcripts
        
    - had some other ideas i forgot
    - maybe
        link to other youtube frontends
- other features
    - support playlists or custom playlists? (can create playlist urls even dynamically)
