- want to add posthog to try it
- social app previews (can use deArrow)
- tasteful extra features (hidden behind tools button)
    - if at all possible: silence skipper
        - we can seek the video through the iframe!
        - and change the playback rate (need to check if supports custom ones)
        - to get silence level, can't go direct to youtube
            - can process video silence timestamps server side (could be a public good database even)
            - could determine it from transcripts
                - can only get timed transcripts from internal yt api / wrapper library of it
        
    - had some other ideas i forgot'
    - A/B history (if can find api)
    - copy transcript (they can paste in an ai to chat if they want... not on me though for those who hate ai)
    - maybe
        link to other youtube frontends
        - maybe "open this video in"
            - yt
            - other yt frontends
                - is linking these will make google mad at me?
            - viewstats
        - download (too tos-y)
- other features
    - support playlists or custom playlists? (can create playlist urls even dynamically)
